# Twitter Bootstrap v3.0.2 for Rails 3/4
Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites.
It includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more.

bootstrap3-rails project integrates Bootstrap CSS (with Sass flavour) and JS toolkits for Rails 3/4 projects. 
It uses the bootstrap3 namespace so it can co-exist with Bootstrap 2 to make migrations easier, especially when depending on other 3rd party engines as rails admin which haven't been migrated to Bootstrap 3 yet.

This is a fork of https://github.com/anjlab/bootstrap-rails, which uses the Bootstrap namespace (without a version number).

## Rails > 3.1

In your Gemfile
``` ruby
gem 'bootstrap3-rails', :github => 'mreinsch/bootstrap3-rails'
```

And run bundle install.

## Stylesheets

1. Rename application.css to application.css.scss
2. Import twitter bootstrap `@import "twitter/bootstrap3";`
3. You can override vars above `@import "twitter/bootstrap3";`

```scss

// change colors
$link-color: red;

// import original bootstrap
@import "twitter/bootstrap3";

```
 NOTE: restart `pow` if you are using it.

## Javascripts

Add necessary javascript(s) files to app/assets/javascripts/application.js

``` javascript
// Include all twitter's javascripts
//= require twitter/bootstrap3

// Or peek any of them yourself
//= require twitter/bootstrap3/transition
//= require twitter/bootstrap3/alert
//= require twitter/bootstrap3/modal
//= require twitter/bootstrap3/dropdown
//= require twitter/bootstrap3/scrollspy
//= require twitter/bootstrap3/tab
//= require twitter/bootstrap3/tooltip
//= require twitter/bootstrap3/popover
//= require twitter/bootstrap3/button

```
